                    Well we're a horse of a different colour that's for sure. While I believe in the core values
                    that the democratic party stands for, I also believe that the parties have lost their way. Everything
                    has become too extreme, too focused on identity politics. It has become about holding the American people
                    hostage to a party line, ra ther than working together to find common ground and solutions.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    I believe in a big tent approach to politics, where everyone is welcome, and everyone has a voice.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    I believe in fiscal responsibility, but also in social justice. I believe in a strong national
                    defense, but also in diplomacy. I believe in the power of government to do good, but also in the
                    power of the individual to make a difference.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    Let's go back to the days of JFK, LBJ, Carter, Regan, and Bush. Let's focus on what unites
                    us, not what divides us. Every person on American soil wants the same things. They want to be
                    safe, they want to be healthy, they want to be educated, they want to work,
                    they want to be happy. Let's work together to make that happen.

                            <p class="lead">
                                For too long, Washington has been run by people who talk about everyday Americans — but rarely with them.
                                The establishment has become too comfortable with gridlock, too focused on power plays and soundbites,
                                and too distant from the struggles that ordinary families face every single day.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">
                                I’m not here to tear people down. I’m here to call us higher. Our leaders aren’t bad people — they’re
                                just stuck in a bad system. One that rewards noise over results, division over cooperation, and
                                personal ambition over public service.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">
                                I’ve lived through the headwinds this country can blow: tragedy, hardship, and the grind that so many
                                Americans know all too well. I’ve seen what it’s like to work hard, care for others, and keep moving
                                forward when the world seems determined to knock you down. That experience doesn’t make me special —
                                it makes me one of you.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">
                                We don’t need more politicians telling us who to blame. We need leaders who understand what it means to
                                build, to listen, and to care. We need people with integrity, empathy, and backbone — people who know
                                that doing the right thing isn’t always the easy thing.
                            </p>

                                My vision is simple:
                                To bring honesty back to politics.
                                To bring respect back to debate.
                                To bring real life back to leadership.

                            <p class="lead">
                                Because the future of this country doesn’t belong to the establishment — it belongs to the people who
                                still believe in something better.
